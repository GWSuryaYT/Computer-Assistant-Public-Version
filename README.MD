You can change the animated visual gif to any thing you wanted just change the gif file name to animation.gif

# Change startup and end sound effects
Same way just remove the file popdown.wav and popup.wav and put yours and rename them but make sure that they are 1-3 sec long and file format is .wav
Use mp3 or mp4 converters to make them .wav
